# Real-time Taxi App

### Using test-driven development (TDD), developed a full stack ride sharing web application. Implemented server-side using Django, PostgreSQL and client-side using React.
### Implemented token-based authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and used local storage of web-browser to store.
### Established bi-directional communication between rider and driver using WebSockets and Django Channels.
### Streamlined the development workflow by adding Docker and used Nginx as reversed proxy to eliminate Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
